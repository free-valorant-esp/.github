# Valorant ESP
ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) in Valorant is a type of software that displays hidden game information such as enemy positions, health, weapons and other key data right on top of the game. Unlike classic cheats (aimbots, voodalls), ESP does not change gameplay directly, but only provides the player with data that would normally be unavailable to him.

## How does ESP work?
ESP fetches data from the game's memory (RAM) or captures network packets and then renders it through:
- Overlay rendering (rendering on top of the game via DirectX/OpenGL hooks);
- External programs (outputting information to a second monitor or device);
- Analyzing sounds and other indirect data (e.g. step tracking).

## ESP Functionality
1. Player positions (through walls, with distance);
2. Health and armor (HP, shields);
3. Weapon types and agent skills;
4. Traps and skills (e.g. Cypher cameras or Killjoy turrets);
5. Grenade and projectile trajectories.

## Is it possible to get a ban?

Most public ESPs are quickly detected, but our ESP uses a sophisticated method of operation: external tracking via machine vision. With this, you can play Valorant without any problems and remain undetected.
